"""Realtime hub state: sessions, rooms, seats and the broadcast fan-out.

The distinction that matters here is **seat vs connection**. A captured session
reconnects to the hub WITHOUT joining again and keeps its place in the room, so a
member cannot be tied to the socket that occupies it. Hence:

* :class:`RoomMember` is a SEAT: identity plus the last known state, and it outlives
  the connection. While disconnected its state is kept as a snapshot so a reconnect
  restores the roster exactly as the other players saw it.
* :class:`HubSession` is one CONNECTION. It holds the live state the handlers mutate
  and is bound to at most one seat.

Rules that come from the capture rather than guesswork:

* the creator of a private hall becomes member id **1** and is the host;
* later joiners get 2, 3, ... and appear to everyone as an ``OnJoin`` broadcast;
* every state change is echoed to the whole room, INCLUDING the member who caused
  it -- the client's own UI renders from the broadcast, not from its own call.
